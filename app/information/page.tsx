                        Wadi Rum, also known as the Valley of the Moon, is a protected desert wilderness in southern
                        Jordan. It features dramatic sandstone mountains, natural arches, and narrow gorges, creating
                        one of the most spectacular desert landscapes in the world.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The area has been inhabited since prehistoric times and has a rich cultural history. It was home
                        to many human civilizations, including the Nabataeans who left their mark with rock inscriptions
                        and temple ruins. More recently, it gained fame as the base of operations for T.E. Lawrence
                        (Lawrence of Arabia) during the Arab Revolt of 1917-18.

                      <p>
                        In 2011, Wadi Rum was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site for both its natural and
                        cultural significance. The protected area covers 720 square kilometers of dramatic desert
                        wilderness.

                        Today, Wadi Rum is a major tourist destination in Jordan, offering visitors the chance to
                        experience the stunning desert landscape through jeep tours, camel rides, hiking, rock climbing,

                <p className="text-lg text-stone-700 mb-8">
                  When visiting Jordan and Wadi Rum, respecting local customs and traditions will enhance your
                  experience and show appreciation for the local culture. Here are some important etiquette tips:
                </p>

                <div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-6">

                    <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4 text-stone-800">Dress Code</h3>
                    <p className="text-stone-700">
                      Jordan is a relatively liberal country by Middle Eastern standards, but modest dress is still
                      appreciated, especially in rural areas. For women, shoulders and knees should be covered. For men,
                      shorts are acceptable in tourist areas but long pants are preferred elsewhere.
                    </p>

                    <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4 text-stone-800">Greetings</h3>
                    <p className="text-stone-700">
                      Jordanians are known for their hospitality. A handshake is the common greeting, though some may
                      place their hand over their heart instead (especially when greeting someone of the opposite
                      gender). Learning a few Arabic phrases like "Marhaba" (hello) and "Shukran" (thank you) is always
                      appreciated.
                    </p>

                    <p className="text-stone-700">
                      Always ask permission before photographing local people, especially Bedouin women. Some may
                      decline or request a small fee. Military installations and airports should not be photographed.
                    </p>

                  <div className="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow-md">

                    <p className="text-stone-700">
                      If invited to a Bedouin meal, it's customary to eat with your right hand. Leaving a small amount
                      of food on your plate indicates you are satisfied; finishing everything might suggest you're still
                      hungry. Refusing tea or coffee can be considered impolite, as hospitality is a cornerstone of
                      Bedouin culture.

                    If visiting during the holy month of Ramadan, be respectful by not eating, drinking, or smoking in
                    public during daylight hours. Most restaurants and cafes will be closed until sunset, though some
                    tourist establishments may remain open.

                          <strong>Jordan Pass:</strong> Consider purchasing a Jordan Pass before arrival, which includes
                          entry to many attractions (including Petra) and waives the tourist visa fee if staying at
                          least 3 nights.

                          <strong>Travel Insurance:</strong> Comprehensive travel insurance is recommended, including
                          coverage for adventure activities if you plan to participate in rock climbing or trekking.

                          <strong>Health:</strong> No special vaccinations are required for Jordan, but it's always good
                          to check with your doctor before traveling.

                          <strong>Currency:</strong> The Jordanian Dinar (JOD) is the local currency. ATMs are available
                          in major cities but not in Wadi Rum, so bring enough cash.

                          <strong>Sun Protection:</strong> The desert sun is intense. Bring sunscreen, a hat,
